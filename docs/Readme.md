# `colors.h` Documentation

The colors.h is a termianl based text coloring header-only library, created for
`c/c++` console applications. Using the ANSI color schemes of terminal, we can
color and adjust other options of text like bold, underline with the help of
escape sequences in `c/c++`. But this library is more compatible with the modern
`cpp` language console apps compared to the `c`, due to the fact that more
reliable features in `cpp` such as the suffix operator `operator""s` enabling
the inline convertion of text into colored text.

## Usage

We have implemented the traditional C style **MACROS**, along with the modern
`cpp` compatible ostream strings.
