# *Colors* in cpp

This is a simple header only cpp programmed api to log messages to console
with colors and more. Mostly all the terminals now-a-days can use and
show colors unlike the MS-DOS old-aged computers. Almost all the linux
distro's from the starting have been supporting the colored output on
the terminal. This api provides simple coloring of the text in all the
basic available colors to the console.

### Which colors:
The following colors are available in this api. See more at docs for
documentation.

- <p style="color:red">Red</p>
- <p style="color:green">Green</p>
- <p style="color:yellow">yellow</p>
- <p style="color:blue">Blue</p>
- <p style="color:magenta">Magenta</p>
- <p style="color:cyan">Cyan</p>
